**https://alainsopp.github.io/All-Rollercoin-Miners/**

This application is intended to provide a complete list of all miners available in the game. 
It comes with a capability of searching and filter on miners with more accuracy. 

**Rollercoin** is providing several ways of filtering on miners.  
Miners have multiple characteristics like **Mining power**, **Price**, **Cell count**, etc.
It is possible to filter on some of them:  

* Name
* Mining power range
* Price range
* Cell count
* Upgrade, witch allows you to search for Basic miners (level I) or Merged miners (level II to VI)

However, some characteristics are not filterable.  
For instance, it is not possible to filter on a miner **Bonus power** wich is another miner characteristic.  
Filtering on an exact miner level (i.e. level II) is not available neither.  
This application add additionnal filters on miner to allow players to search for a desired miner with more
accuracy.
